# PRINCIPAL-COMPONENT-ANALYSIS
This repository contains a university-level project on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), completed as part of a math course. The goal is to explore dimensionality reduction techniques by analyzing real or simulated datasets, computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and interpreting principal components to uncover meaningful patterns in data.

The project includes:
	•	Step-by-step PCA implementation using Python (NumPy / Matplotlib)
	•	Data preprocessing and centering
	•	Manual and automated computation of principal components
	•	Projection onto reduced dimensions
	•	Visualization and interpretation of results

This work was submitted as part of a Bachelor of Engineering curriculum and reflects both theoretical understanding and practical application of PCA in data analysis.
